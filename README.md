# V-store-rest-api
An API used my front-end project of an store [click here to visit it](https://github.com/VitorFigm/React_V_Store)
With this API, we can request information about real amazon's products such as name, price, url to buy those. It allows us to query those by name and apply some filters, like order by price or by ratings

## [Url of the API](https://the-v-store.herokuapp.com/)
# almost 500 real products
all products were taken from the amazon original database
